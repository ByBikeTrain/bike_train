			Biketrains help bicyclists cycle social and cycle safer: meet at different points along a regular route and commute together, enjoying the company of your fellow cyclists and the visibility that numbers provide. Biketrains are designed for anyone whoâ€™d like a more social and safer way to commute by bike. Newer, less experienced riders who can gain confidence and learn safe cycling habits from more experienced bike commuters are especially welcome.
